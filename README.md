👋 Hi, I’m Hamid Heyhat (@HHeyhat), an innovative entrepreneur and technologist dedicated to pushing the boundaries in the tech industry. As the founder and CEO of CHIUVANA LLC, my expertise lies in creating transformative solutions ranging from e-commerce platforms to AI-driven health and wellness applications.

👀 I’m deeply interested in the fusion of technology with daily life, particularly the potential of AI and machine learning to disrupt traditional industries and enhance city living. My projects reflect a commitment to this vision, like the revolutionary Smart City AI initiative designed to improve urban sustainability and efficiency.

🌱 Currently, I’m expanding my knowledge in cloud-native technologies and cybersecurity. I’m fascinated by how these can be harnessed to build resilient and scalable business solutions and protect our digital ecosystems against emerging threats.

💞️ Looking to collaborate on projects that dare to innovate and require a unique mix of creativity and technical know-how. I am especially keen on ventures in AI, cloud computing, and environmental sustainability within tech.
